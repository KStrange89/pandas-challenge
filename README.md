## Heroes of Pymoli

Heroes of Pymoli is a Free-to-Play, Pay-to-PWN game. The in-app purchases include epic items and skills to enhance the players experience. The creators of Heroes of Pymoli have asked to have meaningful insights taken from it's purchasing data.

To do this, I used Pandas in Python.

I found that while the majority of players identify as male, those players spend the least on average. I also found that players below the age of 10 spend the most, on average, out of any age group. However, the 20-24 age range has the second largest average purchase price and so, because the 20-24 age range has considerably more players and more purchases, they are the group that provides the greatest revenue.
